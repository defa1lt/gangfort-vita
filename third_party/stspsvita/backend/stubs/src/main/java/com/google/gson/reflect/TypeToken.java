/**
 * gson TypeToken shadow. Real gson resolves the captured type argument via
 * Class.getGenericSuperclass(), which TeaVM's classlib doesn't provide.
 * Instead, the asset pipeline scans the user's jar for TypeToken subclasses
 * at build time and registers each one's generic signature here (the game
 * only ever creates them as anonymous subclasses, e.g. SaveHelper$1), so
 * resolution becomes a name lookup with no runtime generic reflection.
 *
 * Until the generated manifest lands, unregistered tokens resolve to their
 * raw marker and Gson's binder treats them as Map/List of JSON natives.
